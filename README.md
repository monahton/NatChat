------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üì¶ Overview

NatChat is an R package designed to facilitate seamless interaction with
the current issues of journals published by the Nature Portfolio. It is
inspired from the [biorecap](https://github.com/stephenturner/biorecap)
R package developed by the talented Stephen Turner. NatChat provides
functions to:

- Identify available Nature journals supported by the package.
- Scrape and retrieve article abstracts from the latest issues of Nature
  journals.
- Construct prompts to summarize articles using large language models
  (LLMs).
- Generate natural language summaries via the ollama interface.
- Format output for markdown tables, reports, or summaries.

This package is particularly useful for researchers, educators, and
clinicians aiming to stay updated with the latest scientific literature
across multiple disciplines through automated summarization and
easy-to-use interfaces.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üíª Installation

You can install the development version of NatChat from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}
pak::pak("monahton/NatChat")
```

``` r
# Load the package
library(NatChat)
```

## üëâ Requirements: Ollama Setup

NatChat uses the `ollamar` package to interface with local large
language models (LLMs) powered by **Ollama**. Before using NatChat‚Äôs
summarization functions, ensure you have the Ollama software installed
on your machine:

- Download and install Ollama from the [official
  site](https://ollama.com/).
- Once installed, verify your setup in R:

``` r
library(NatChat)
test_connection()    # Checks if Ollama is correctly connected
list_models()        # Lists available LLM models for summarization
```

Make sure Ollama is running and accessible to R before proceeding with
summarization tasks.

## üìÅ Functions Highlights

| Function | Description |
|----|----|
| `nat_journals()` | Lists all supported Nature Portfolio journals available for scraping. |
| `get_articles()` | Retrieves article metadata and abstracts from the current issue. |
| `filter_articles()` | Filters articles based on user-defined criteria (e.g., keywords). |
| `build_prompt()` | Creates custom prompts from article titles and abstracts for LLM summarization. |
| `add_summary()` | Generates natural language summaries using the Ollama interface and LLMs. |
| `save_report()` | Saves the final formatted summaries into a report file. |
