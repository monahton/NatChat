\description{
This function scrapes articles from the current issue of a specified Nature journal,
extracting article titles, URLs, and abstracts with robust fallback handling.
}
\details{
The journal argument is matched (case-insensitively) against available entries from \code{nat_journals()}.
If not found, an informative error is thrown. Abstracts that are missing are replaced with "Abstract not available".
If titles, URLs, and abstracts differ in length, they are truncated to the shortest length with a warning.
