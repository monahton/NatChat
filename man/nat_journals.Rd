\usage{
nat_journals(journal = NULL)
}

to filter the list. If \code{NULL} (default), returns the full table of available journals and slugs.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\describe{
\item{journal}{The full name of the journal}

}
}
\description{
This function returns a data frame of \emph{Nature} journals supported by the \code{Natchat} package,
including their full names and URL slugs (used in links or programmatic access). Optionally,
users can provide a journal name to filter and display only the matching journal and its slug.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The \code{slug} corresponds to the subdirectory used in Nature URLs (e.g., \code{"https://www.nature.com/nbt/"} for \emph{Nature Biotechnology}).
\item Journal name matching is case-insensitive and supports exact matches only (no partial or fuzzy matching).
